## GameTheory
### A library to make 2D Java game development simple.

In an effort to teach myself Java Swing development, I thought, "Why not learn while also creating something that other people can use?" So I am.

GameTheory is a Java library/framework designed to make 2D game development as easy as possible. It's taking a lot of inspiration from GameMaker Studio, so if you've used GM:S before, you should be familiar with the basic concepts of GameTheory.

GameTheory is a room-and-event based system. You create objects and add them to rooms. Each room represents an object layout as well as window properties, which you define. Your rooms and objects, in turn, react to the game and player input via events, and you attach your own event listeners to handle the response to those events.
